"""
Chat with Memory Example
=========================

Demonstrates how to use Engram as persistent memory for a conversational AI.
A mock LLM (no OpenAI or other external service required) carries on a
multi-turn conversation while Engram stores and retrieves relevant memories.

Key concepts shown:

1. Creating a MemoryClient with the in-memory driver
2. Simulating a multi-turn conversation with a simple mock LLM
3. Storing each turn as episodic memory via ``add_sync``
4. Retrieving relevant memories before generating each response via ``search_sync``
5. Watching memories accumulate over turns
